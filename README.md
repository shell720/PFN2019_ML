# PFN2019_ML

This is a log for myself when I tried to work on the PFN intern MachineLearing assignment to test my skills.
Learning efficiency is not very efficient because I didn't consider setting up a mini-batch.

I wrote these programs before commited, so I forget the details what types of bugs I embedded in them.
But I mainly learned how to use Class and I often mistake the varialbes' name of arguments and constracts.



/src/_kadai are the programs that messed up and throwed away in the middle, and hen re-written anew. /src/kadai are the official code.
